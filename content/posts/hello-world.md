Welcome to **REPL Yell!** - a place where I'll share thoughts on programming, technology, and the occasional deep dive into Lisp and systems programming.

## Why "REPL Yell"?

The name is a play on "Rebel Yell" - but for those of us who spend our days in REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops). There's something rebellious about interactive programming in an age of heavyweight IDEs and complex build systems.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Common Lisp** - My favorite language for exploratory programming
- **Systems Programming** - Low-level hacking and performance optimization
- **Tools & Workflows** - Building better developer experiences
- **Open Source** - Projects I'm working on

Here's a taste of what we'll be exploring:

```lisp
(defun hello-world ()
  "The traditional greeting, Lisp style."
  (format t "Hello, World!~%")
  (format t "Welcome to REPL Yell!~%"))

(hello-world)
```

Stay tuned for more!
