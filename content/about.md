I'm **Anthony Green**, a Distinguished Solution Architect at Red Hat based in Toronto, Canada. I've been creating open source software since the mid-90s and still love it.

## Notable Projects

**[libffi](https://github.com/libffi/libffi)** — I created this foreign function interface library back in 1996. It's now embedded in Python, Ruby, Firefox's JavaScript engine, OpenJDK, GNOME, Wayland, and the vast majority of Linux systems worldwide.

**[Moxie](https://moxielogic.github.io/blog/)** — An open source microprocessor architecture I designed, with implementations on FPGA platforms and in blockchain applications.

**[ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl)** — An OCI-based distribution system for Common Lisp libraries.

## Interests

I'm into compilers, language runtimes, CPU architecture, Common Lisp, DevOps/SRE tooling, and increasingly, AI/LLM integration. I also volunteer as a GNU Toolchain maintainer and mentor CS/AI students at the University of Toronto.
